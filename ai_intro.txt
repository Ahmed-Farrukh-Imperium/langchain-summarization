Artificial Intelligence (AI) has its roots in the mid-20th century. In 1950, Alan Turing published his famous paper "Computing Machinery and Intelligence," proposing the idea of machines that could simulate any aspect of human intelligence. His "Turing Test" became a landmark concept in determining whether a machine can exhibit human-like behavior. In 1956, the Dartmouth Conference, organized by John McCarthy, Marvin Minsky, Nathaniel Rochester, and Claude Shannon, is considered the official birth of AI as a field. The conference introduced the term "Artificial Intelligence" and inspired early research into symbolic reasoning and problem-solving. 
The 1960s and 1970s saw optimism in AI development, with programs like ELIZA, an early chatbot developed by Joseph Weizenbaum, demonstrating natural language capabilities. Expert systems in the 1980s, such as MYCIN for medical diagnosis, showed the practical potential of AI but also highlighted challenges in scaling and adaptability. By the late 1980s, AI faced an "AI winter," a period of reduced funding and interest due to unmet expectations.
AI revived in the 1990s and 2000s with improvements in computing power and the growth of machine learning. In 1997, IBM’s Deep Blue defeated chess champion Garry Kasparov, a milestone that captured global attention. The 2010s saw breakthroughs in deep learning, driven by large datasets and powerful GPUs. ImageNet competitions showcased the rapid progress of neural networks, while tools like Google Translate improved language translation. Voice assistants like Siri and Alexa entered daily life, showing AI’s consumer impact.
Recent milestones include OpenAI’s GPT models and Google’s AlphaGo defeating Go champion Lee Sedol in 2016. These events underscored AI’s ability to master complex tasks previously thought impossible. Today, AI continues to shape industries, research, and society, raising both excitement and debate about its future role.
